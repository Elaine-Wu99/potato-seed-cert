Questions for Renee:
- who collects this data? how often updated? who updates it?
    - every year, new inspections are appended to this spreadsheet
- do we want visualization tools for the stored database only, or any other data that people want to upload (this is harder)?
    - we want for this data, but also new data uploaded every year
    - ideally we want to automate the process (collect data in an ipad and uploaded to the cloud)

# Meeting with Renee (9/22)
- seed certification: check growers to certify their seed
- check for viruses and also that they are the right variety

- they want two main things:
    - better database
    - models for trends

- there will be info on yield later (we want to predict it)

- data: each row is a sample of potato (seed potato lot)
    - there is a difference between grower (where the potato is grown) and source (where the tubers came from). they are certifying the grower

- what do we want to see in this data?
    - trends: in inspection, they check if plants have virus and if they are the right variety
    - NO_MOS: number of mosaic virus plants; our viruses start ub column Z NO_LR
    - NO_MIX: not correct variety
